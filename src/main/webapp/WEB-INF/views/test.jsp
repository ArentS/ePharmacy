			<h1>3 Ways to Reduce the Risk of Asthma in Early Childhood</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="contentText">
			<p>Pharmacists can help inform their patients with young
						children about a few ways to reduce their kids risk of developing
						asthma.</p>
			
			<p>Here are some tips to lessen the chances that a child
						develops the disease.</p>
					<br>
					<h5>
						<strong>1. Animal fur exposure may help.</strong>
					</h5>

					<p>Sleeping on animal fur in infancy may reduce the risk of
						asthma later in childhood, according to recent research.</p>

					<p>A study evaluated the effects of sleeping on animal fur in
						the first 3 months of life compared with children who were not
						exposed to animal skin. The researchers found that children who
						slept on fur had a 79% lower chance of having asthma by the time
						they were age 6. By the time the children were aged 10, the risk
						decreased to 41%.</p>

					<br>
					<h5>
						<strong>2. Farm dust may protect against asthma risk.</strong>
					</h5>


					<p>Researchers have determined that farm dust can make the
						mucus membrane in the respiratory tracts react less severely to
						allergens like house dust mites, thereby making an individual less
						susceptible to allergies and asthma.</p>

					<p>Patients with allergies and asthma have a deficiency in a
						protective protein called A20, which causes them to suffer more
						from allergens. </p>

					<br>
					<h5>
						<strong>3. Dirt and dander have their benefits. </strong>
					</h5>

					<p>Rodent dander, pet dander, roach allergens, and household
						bacteria exposure may reduce asthma risk, wheezing, and allergy
						risk when infants are exposed to them, researchers from Johns
						Hopkins Medicine determined.</p>

					<p>"What this tells us is that not only are many of our immune
						responses shaped in the first year of life, but also that certain
						bacteria and allergens play an important role in stimulating and
						training the immune system to behave a certain way," study author
						Robert Wood, MD, said in a press release.</p>
