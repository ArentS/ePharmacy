			<h1>Fish and Omega-3 Fatty Acids</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="contentText">
			<p>The American Heart Association recommends eating fish
						(particularly fatty fish) at least two times (two servings) a
						week. Each serving is 3.5 ounce cooked, or about ¾ cup of flaked
						fish. Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, herring, lake trout,
						sardines and albacore tuna are high in omega-3 fatty acids.

						Increasing omega-3 fatty acid consumption through foods is
						preferable. However, those with coronary artery disease, may not
						get enough omega-3 by diet alone. These people may want to talk to
						their doctor about supplements. And for those with high
						triglycerides, even larger doses could help.</p>

					<p>The benefits and risks of eating fish vary depending on a
						person's stage of life.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Children and pregnant women are advised by the U.S. Food
							and Drug Administration (FDA) to avoid eating those fish with the
							potential for the highest level of mercury contamination (e.g.,
							shark, swordfish, king mackerel or tilefish); to eat up to 12
							ounces (two average meals) per week of a variety of fish and
							shellfish that are lower in mercury (e.g., canned light tuna,
							salmon, pollock, catfish); and check local advisories about the
							safety of fish caught by family and friends in local lakes,
							rivers and coastal areas.</li>

						<li>For middle-aged and older men and postmenopausal women,
							the benefits of fish consumption far outweigh the potential risks
							when the amount of fish are eaten is within the recommendations
							established by the FDA and Environmental Protection Agency.</li>

						<li>Eating a variety of fish will help minimize any
							potentially adverse effects due to environmental pollutants.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Five of the most commonly eaten fish or shellfish that are
						low in mercury are shrimp, canned light tuna, salmon, pollock, and
						catfish. Avoid eating shark, swordfish, king Mackerel, or tilefish
						because they contain high levels of mercury.</p>
