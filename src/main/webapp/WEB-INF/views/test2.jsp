			<h1>Dehydration</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="contentText">
			<p>Every tissue and organ within the body depends on water. It
						helps carry nutrients and minerals to cells, and keeps your mouth,
						nose, and throat moist - important for avoiding illness. Even
						though the body is made up of 60 percent water, you lose fluids
						through urination, bowel movements, sweating, and even breathing.
						Dehydration occurs when you don't adequately replace the fluids
						you lose.</p>

					<p>Mild to moderate dehydration is sometimes difficult to
						identify, but it can make you sick. Symptoms of mild to moderate
						dehydration can be mistaken for general aches and pains, fatigue,
						headache, and constipation. Both acute and chronic dehydration can
						be dangerous, even life threatening.</p>

					<p>Symptoms include:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Extreme thirst</li>
						<li>Sunken eyes</li>
						<li>Headache</li>
						<li>Low blood pressure</li>
						<li>Fast heartbeat</li>
						<li>Confusion or lethargy</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The treatment is simple: sip water all day long, especially
						in hot or humid conditions. Eating foods with a high water
						content, such as fruits and vegetables, also keeps you hydrated
						throughout the day. As long as you urinate regularly and don't
						feel thirsty, you're likely drinking enough to stay hydrated.
						Another gauge of adequate hydration is that your urine color
						should be clear (or almost clear).</p>
